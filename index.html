            <p class="">You will have the ability to sell your games using any payment method that we can integrate into DEGA Store's system. Bitcoin will, of course, be implemented, and depending on the technicalities of traditional payment systems, they will also be integrated. If one service denies you, another would be available for you to set up, and so on. <br><br>(Implementation is one aspect; your setup of each payment method is another.)</p>

            <p class="">Since we are not a middleman between the buyer and seller, and payment setup is handled by the seller, the game producer receives 100% of the sale, and DEGA Store does not take a cut. DEGA Store's revenue stream is generated elsewhere.</p>

            <p class="">Since DEGA Store does not control account creation or manage them, and only has copies of pages, posts, and builds (assuming the studio has set things up correctly), it is not the one selling games or acting as an intermediary between the buyer and seller. Therefore, any attempt by a third party to pressure DEGA Store to stop a game producer from selling their game is impossible, even if DEGA faces the threat of having its banking services revoked.<br><br>Essentially, think of DEGA Store as a browser. Furthermore, in the event that DEGA Store goes under, sellers can still sell their games, and the store would remain functional (there would just be a small hiccup period of a worse user experience until sellers reconfigure/reset up their store with the same system). <br><br>A domain is not needed, and backend reconfiguration and setup by the seller using their own resources can be done, ensuring that sellers can get out of relying on DEGA Store.</p>

            <p class="">Yes, many of the systems that will be developed for DEGA Store have already been developed and implemented in a different project. The only system we are not 100% sure about is the multiple payment methods system, as we have not explored that yet. However, we are optimistic about it and will update this answer with good news in the future.</p>

          <div class="w-full p-[20px]">
            <p class="">Developers need storage and bandwidth for their game builds, as well as reliable speeds, so we will be providing that. Essentially, we are focused on building a strong backend infrastructure. This forms the initial core of our business model, and there are additional revenue streams to be implemented.</p>

            <p class="">We are currently focused on a different project, and DEGA Store is certainly a larger endeavor than it. As soon as that project begins generating profits with decent margins, a percentage of those profits will be allocated to fund the development of DEGA Store, or we may seek investors to support it. However, please keep in mind that what is developed for that project will most likely be utilized for DEGA Store, so with that in mind, you can assume that we are already building it. We are in the final stages of planning, and the frontend design is being developed in our free time whenever possible.</p>
